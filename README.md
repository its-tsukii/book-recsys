Bookify is a web-based book recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering machine learning algorithms to suggest books to users based on their reading preferences.<br> Built using Flask, HTML, and CSS, Bookify provides a user-friendly interface for users to discover new books and authors.

- Deployed Link : (brs-python.koyeb.app)

 - Technologies Used:

      - Flask: A micro web framework for building web applications<br>
      - HTML/CSS: For building the user interface and user experience<br>
      - Python: For building the collaborative filtering machine learning model<br>
      - scikit-learn: A machine learning library for building and training the model<br>
      - Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis<br>
      - NumPy: A library for numerical computations<br>

 - Features:

       - User registration and login: Users can create an account and log in to access their personalized book recommendations<br>
       - Book catalog: A comprehensive catalog of books with metadata such as title, author, genre, and summary<br>
       - Rating system: Users can rate books they've read to help improve the recommendation engine<br>
       - Recommendation engine: The system uses collaborative filtering to suggest books to users based on their reading preferences<br>
       - Book search: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre<br>
       - User dashboard: Users can view their recommended books, reading history, and ratings<br>
       - Collaborative Filtering Model: The collaborative filtering model is built using the user-book rating matrix, where users are represented as rows and books are represented as columns. 

 - The model uses the following techniques:

       - User-based collaborative filtering: The model recommends books to a user based on the ratings of similar users<br>
       - Item-based collaborative filtering: The model recommends books that are similar to the ones a user has already rated highly<br>

 - Goals and Objectives:

       - Provide accurate and personalized book recommendations to users<br>
       - Help users discover new books and authors<br>
       - Improve the user experience through a user-friendly interface and relevant recommendations<br>
       - Continuously improve the recommendation engine through machine learning and user feedback<br>

 - Target Audience:

       - Avid readers who want to discover new books and authors<br>
       - Book clubs and reading groups who want to find new books to discuss<br>
       - Authors and publishers who want to promote their books to relevant audiences<br>
       - Development Status: Currently in development, with a target release date of [23/08/2024].
